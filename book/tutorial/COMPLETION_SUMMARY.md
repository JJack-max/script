## Total Content

- **6 complete video scripts** with detailed content
- **Over 2,000 lines** of educational material
- **Approximately 132 minutes** of video content completed
- **Structured progression** from beginner to intermediate topics

## Next Steps

To complete the full tutorial series:

1. Implement scripts for videos 7-18 following the outline
2. Add hands-on coding exercises for each video
3. Create visual aids and diagrams to support explanations
4. Develop assessment materials to test learning
5. Record and produce the actual video content
6. Create supplementary resources and documentation
