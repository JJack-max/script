# Solana Principles Tutorial Series

Welcome to the Solana Principles tutorial series! This collection focuses on the underlying principles, mechanisms, and theoretical foundations that make Solana work.

Unlike the practical tutorial series, this content dives deep into the "why" and "how" behind Solana's architecture, consensus mechanisms, and design decisions.

## Series Outline

### Part 1: Foundational Principles
1. Distributed Systems Fundamentals 📝
2. Cryptographic Primitives in Solana 📝

### Part 2: Solana's Core Innovations
3. [Proof of History (PoH) Explained](video-1-script.md) ✅
4. [Tower BFT Consensus](video-2-script.md) ✅
5. [Pipeline Architecture (Sealevel)](video-3-script.md) ✅

### Part 3: Network and Storage
6. Gulf Stream - Transaction Forwarding 📝
7. Turbine - Data Propagation 📝
8. Archivers - Distributed Storage 📝

### Part 4: Economic and Game Theoretic Principles
9. Solana's Economic Model 📝
10. Game Theory in Solana 📝

### Part 5: Advanced Topics and Research
11. Performance Limits and Scaling 📝
12. Security Model Analysis 📝
13. Cross-Chain Interoperability 📝
14. Future Research Directions 📝

### Bonus Content
- Solana vs Other Consensus Mechanisms 📝
- Formal Verification of Solana Protocols 📝
- Solana's Approach to Decentralization 📝
